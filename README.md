# C-Weather: Compose with weather

<!--- Replace <OWNER> with your Github Username and <REPOSITORY> with the name of your repository. -->
<!--- You can find both of these in the url bar when you open your repository in github. -->
![Workflow result](https://github.com/Mercandj/android-dev-challenge-compose-4/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

Requirement: Replace `WeatherApiManagerImpl#YOUR_KEY_HERE_WITH_FORECAST_AVAILABLE` by your openweathermap key

## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->

* Neumorphism simple weather app that support different temperature units and cities.
* Based on [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) and [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/), built for the [Jetpack Compose challenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge) week 4.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->

**What am I proud of?**
- Split UI and logic
- "Useful" app
   - -> Real data forecast
   - -> Persistence of the forecast
   - -> Change your City / temperature Unit
- Neumorphism UI

## Side notes

This is the first time I'm trying Jetpack Compose.
Even if the spirit seems to be reactive paradigm, I will try to use it on a more "classic" way.

**Why?**
- Because, if one day I will use this techno in production, I will need a "transition" phase to not move all my code to the "reactive" way.
- Because stay "non reactive" is easier for the reactive-beginner that I am. I hope that my project demonstrates that Jetpack Compose work well without intensive use of ViewModel, LiveData...
- Because stay "non reactive" allow you to produce almost the same code on any platform easily (Unity, iOS, server...)

**My goals will be:**
- Discover Jetpack Compose
- Split as much as possible logic from the UI with the good old "MVP"
- Great UI / Great app quality (app we can publish on Google Play)

**Architecture**
- Code and resources split by `feature` instead of `layer` to be able to scale
- DepInjection done manually and user Dagger notions: graph, module, manager...
- Basic MVP explicit in Contract interfaces

**Bonus**
- Translated in french üá´üá∑

**Requirement if you a coming from "stable Android Studio" on MacOs**
- Download Java 11 (for example [here](https://jdk.java.net/archive/))
- Add it like that: `/Users/jonathan/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.2.jdk`
- If cannot open the jdk due to mac os permission, [here](https://superuser.com/a/1537706) a tip)
